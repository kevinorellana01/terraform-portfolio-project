## Quick Overview of Next.js

Next.js is an open-source React framework designed for building modern, scalable, and SEO-friendly web applications. Key features include:
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **File-Based Routing**
- **Built-In API Routes**
- **Automatic Code Splitting**

For more details, visit the [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## Steps to Deploy the Portfolio

### 1. Prepare the Next.js Application

#### 1.1 Create a GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub and create a repository named `terraform-portfolio-project`.
2. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
    cd terraform-portfolio-project
    ```

#### 1.2 Clone the Next.js Portfolio Starter Kit
1. Clone the starter kit:
    ```bash
    npx create-next-app@latest nextjs-blog --use-npm --example "https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/tree/main/basics/learn-starter"
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and start the app:
    ```bash
    cd blog
    npm run dev
    ```

#### 1.3 Update Next.js Configuration
1. Create a file named `next.config.js` in the root folder and add the following:
    ```javascript
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
    };

    module.exports = nextConfig;
    ```
2. Build the static site:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
   This will generate an `out` folder.

#### 1.4 Push Code to GitHub
1. Initialize Git and push the project:
    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit of Next.js portfolio starter kit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/terraform-portfolio-project.git
    git push -u origin master
    ```

### 2. Set Up Terraform Configuration

#### 2.1 Create Terraform Directory
```bash
mkdir terraform-nextjs
cd terraform-nextjs
```

#### 2.2 Create Terraform Files
1. **State Management**: Configure S3 and DynamoDB for storing the Terraform state.
2. **Provider Block**: Add AWS provider configurations in `main.tf`.
3. **S3 Bucket**: Create an S3 bucket for static website hosting with properties like `index_document` and `error_document`.
4. **Bucket Policy**: Add an S3 bucket policy to allow public read access.
5. **CloudFront Distribution**: Configure CloudFront with the following:
    - Origin pointing to the S3 bucket.
    - Viewer protocol policy: `redirect-to-https`.
    - Default cache behavior for `GET` and `HEAD` requests.
6. **Outputs**: Define outputs for the S3 bucket name and CloudFront domain.

#### 2.3 Initialize Terraform
```bash
terraform init
```

#### 2.4 Plan and Apply Terraform
1. Preview the changes:
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```
2. Apply the changes:
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

---

### 3. Deploy the Next.js Static Site
1. Upload the `out` folder to the S3 bucket:
    ```bash
    aws s3 sync ../blog/out s3://<your-s3-bucket-name>
    ```
2. Retrieve the CloudFront URL:
    ```bash
    terraform output cloudfront_url
    ```
3. Access the website using the CloudFront URL.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Automated AWS resource creation with Terraform.
- **Global Content Delivery**: Optimized performance with CloudFront.
- **Scalability**: Seamless handling of traffic spikes.
- **Cost Optimization**: Static hosting with S3 and on-demand scaling.
